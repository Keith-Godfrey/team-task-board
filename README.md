# team-task-board
I created a simple task board application that allows a team to manage project tasks by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## User Story 
As a project team member with multiple tasks to organize. I want a task board so that I can add individual project tasks, manage their state of progress, and track overall project progress accordingly.
